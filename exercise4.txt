In addition to the same code and theory used in exercise 3.

I needed to determine the key length that was previously give to me.
I started by looking at the encryption and found common patterns of three 
letters and counted the difference between them, on the basis that they key 
was probably at the same place when it encrypted both parts. 

‘WZZ’ appears and soon after is repeated in the exact same order. We can 
guess that the same original letters were encrypted with the same part of 
the key at these points. By working out which number bridges the gap while 
ensuring all three characters are at the same point gives the key length of 7.

I put my key length into my code from exercise 3 to decrypt. I knew from the 
first time I used it the frequency analysis isn’t 100% so I broke my codes 
attempted decryption up into groups of my calculated key length and looked 
for patterns. There were consistent points at 3 and 4 where potential words 
were being disrupted and points at 12567 which made full words:

ENGRWHI CHWUEEX = points 5,6,7,1,2 spells the word 'which' (words appeared 
complete at these points multiple times)

Knowing this I could change my keys at 3 and 4 until I completed an obvious 
word:

GTLRLES SWSETHY = “less worthy” - "SE" turned into "OR" completes a word that 
couldn't be spelt any other way and make sense in context to the word next 
to it.

I then found the original character index in the encryption to can obtain the 
initial character and got the difference between that and my guess of O and R 
(in the above example) which completed my key and provides a full decryption 
for the rest of the message.
