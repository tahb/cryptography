Using Ruby I created a method which analysed the encrypted message and found th
e most common letter by iterating over each letter and adding one to its 
counter. As in the english alphabet 'E' is the most frequently used character
I could presume that the most common letter in the encryption (which was ‘X’) 
was originally 'E' in the plaintext decryption.

Knowing this I found the difference between 'E' and 'X' which is 19, 
this gives me the shift amount used in encryption. As this is a caesar cipher 
I also know that this shift amount is used on every letter in the original 
message to form the encryption.

Now I iterated over each character and moved it 19 spaces to the left to find
its original value. Using modulo 26 (alphabet length) to wrap around if the 
number fell into minus figures.


An alternative way of finding the shift amount would of been manually changing
the shift amount variable for each number between 1 and 25 (as 0 is the current
state) until the output (decryption) became legible.
