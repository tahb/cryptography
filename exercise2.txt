First I had to create a new key that took the given key and duplicated it so it 
covered the length of any incoming message including any remainders at the 
end. This gave me a key string the same length as the encryption which is 
important because that aligns each character with the part of the key it was 
originally encrypted with.

Next I iterated over each letter in the key, I could of gone over each letter in
the encryption but they were the same length so it didn't matter. As I went 
I kept track of the index position in the key for comparison with the 
encryption. I found out the index value of that key letter in the alphabet 
to which returned a number between 0-25. With this number I compared 
it (using the stored index number) to the same point in the message and 
shifted it by that amount, again using modulo to handle the wrap around.

I put this new character into an answer array which slowly formed the 
complete decryption.
